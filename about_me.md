Not only I work developing software, I love programming 👨🏻‍💻. I keep up to date by following engineering blogs from top companies and interesting twitter accounts, where I also follow high profile devs.

🎧 Music is very important in my life. Playing in a rock 🎸 band with my high school friends was one of the most fun experiences I had.

As practically everyone in Uruguay I love Fútbol ⚽️, but I'm not good at it 👎
